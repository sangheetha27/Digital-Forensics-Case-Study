# Digital-Forensics-Case-Study

This project was a complete case study done by me under the supervision of Professor Dr Amani Ibrahim. A thorough digital forensics report was written by analyzing the various evidences that was found by cracking passwords, decryption and by using several digital forensics software such as OpenPuff, Stegbreak, S-Tools and JPseek Tools.
